/*
fnfVersion represents the Friday Night Funkin' game version. This should always remain "0.2.7.1" as GophEngine is based on FNF v0.2.7.1.

This version was chosen because it's the last "normal" version before NSFW & violent cutscenes (introduced in FNF v0.3.2), which conflicts with the project's goals.
I strongly oppose this kind of content and behavior and want to create a family-friendly alternative, as it can be distressing for many, including myself.
Additionally, FNF v0.2.7.1 is stable and well-supported by the modding community and third-party engines (e.g., Kade Engine, Psych Engine).
