# GophEngine

**[Po Slovensky](https://github.com/MatusOllah/gophengine/blob/main/README.sk-SK.md)**

Status: work-in-progress

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/MatusOllah/gophengine.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MatusOllah/gophengine)

**GophEngine** is a Go implementation of **Friday Night Funkin'** with improvments.

**NOTE**: This is a mod. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a modification.

## Why?

I wanted to make a easy to use Go (my fav programming language) modding API for Friday Night Funkin' (my fav game) (something like MinecraftForge but for FNF).
I also wanted to fix everything what's wrong with the vanilla FNF engine and add some more features and improvments.

### Why Go?

Go is my favourite programming language and I don't wanna learn Haxe.

## Naming

"Goph" means Go Gopher (Go programming language mascot) and "Engine" means FNF engine.
I wanted to call this funkin-go, but "I made a mod with GophEngine" just sounds more natural than "I made a mod with funkin-go".
