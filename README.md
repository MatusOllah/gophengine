**GophEngine** is a Go implementation of **Friday Night Funkin'** with improvments.

**NOTE**: This is a mod. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a modification.

## Why?

I wanted to make a easy to use modding Go API for Friday Night Funkin' (something like MinecraftForge but for FNF).

### Why Go?

Go is my favourite programming language and I don't wanna learn Haxe.

## Notable tools and libraries
