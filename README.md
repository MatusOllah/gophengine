# GophEngine

**GophEngine** is a Go implementation of **Friday Night Funkin'** with improvments.

**NOTE**: This is a mod. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a modification.

## Why?

I wanted to make a easy to use Go (my fav programming language) modding API for Friday Night Funkin' (my fav game) (something like MinecraftForge but for FNF).
I also wanted to fix everything what's wrong with the vanilla FNF engine and add some more features and improvments.

### Why Go?

Go is my favourite programming language and I don't wanna learn Haxe.
