**GophEngine** (short for "Gopher Engine") is a Go port of **Friday Night Funkin'** (a popular FOSS rhythm game) with improvements, bringing new features, performance enhancements, and a cleaner experience. Built from the ground up in **Go and Ebitengine**, GophEngine aims to provide an easy-to-use modding framework and foster a supportive community for FNF fans.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the vanilla game. This is a fan-made remake of the original game and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Funkin' Crew or Newgrounds.
> Think of GophEngine as to FNF what Black Mesa is to Half-Life - a fan-made remake and improvement, built from the ground up.

## Why?

I created GophEngine for several reasons:

* To develop an easy-to-use Go modding MDK for Friday Night Funkin', similar to MinecraftForge but for FNF.
* To fix issues in the vanilla FNF engine and add new features and improvements.
* To foster a positive and supportive community around the game, free from the toxicity often seen in other modding circles.
* To remove inappropriate or overly graphic content introduced in later FNF versions and create a cleaner, more accessible version of the game.
* To rewrite the game in Go, my favorite programming language.

### Why Go?

Go is my favorite programming language, and I prefer it over learning Haxe.
It also offers better performance, simpler concurrency, and faster compile times compared to Haxe, making it ideal for building a high-octane rhythm game like FNF.

## Planned Features

* Enhanced privacy with no Newgrounds integration
* Entirely written in Go with no Haxe
* Family-friendly and strict Code of Conduct
* Small tweaks and optimizations for a smoother and more enjoyable experience
* Lower RAM consumption and overall smaller footprint
* A proper options menu for better customization
* Robust Go modding MDK for easy modification
* Faster compile times
* ...and much more! üòâ

## Building & installing (from source)

For detailed build instructions, refer to [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).
You'll need Go installed and basic command-line knowledge to get started.

## Naming

The name "GophEngine" combines "Goph" (representing Gopher, the Go programming language mascot) and "Engine" (representing the FNF engine). It felt more fitting and natural for this project than the alternative proposed name "funkin-go".
